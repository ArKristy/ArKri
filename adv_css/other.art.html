                Paper has been one of my favorite hobbies, but it is a little messy. To sum up the process, recycled paper is soaked for a while, blended, then strained in whatever shape. It's satisfying building a book of your own, it could even be a book for watercolor or gouache! Making paper does, however, require a lot of tools on its own, along with plenty of space to allow the paper to dry over a period of time. The end result to me is so worth it!

            <h3>Enjoy painting? Try clay!</h3>

                Clay is so diverse, its products able to range from something that simply looks pretty to something that is fully functional in your home. Cups, trays, earrings, statues, and more can all be made with air-dry clay! Which is the best clay to use, in my opinion, especially when only doing it for fun. I have made several jewelery trays, incense burners, and functional mugs! Acrylic paint is typically used after it has dried, since it dries waterproof after all. Then, cover with a sealant and you have a beautiful, handmade, functional piece to call your own!
