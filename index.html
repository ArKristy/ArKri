    <h2>Painting</h2>
    <img src="images/paintbrushes.jpg" alt="paintbrushes">
    <p>There are many different kinds of paint! So, if you have tried one, maybe there is another that is a better fit for you. Some popular kinds are acrylic, watercolor, and gouache. All of these paints are water based, they just have different consistencies. Watercolor is like a dry pressed powder, so in order to paint with it, water is required. It lays on lightly and usually looks best with several layers. Acrylic is thicker, it isn't dry and doesn't always need water, but it looks best when water is in use. It dries rather quickly, and has a variety of tones and hues, and layering is not required for good results. Gouache is a very popular paint, it is almost a combination of the two paints previously mentioned, which in my opinon makes it the best. It takes the water activation aspect from watercolor but without drying out like acrylic. It has extremely vibrant colors, even more so than acrylic, but needs only one layer unlike watercolor. It lays very smooth and bright, so painting with it can be very therapeutic and satisfying.

    <h3>Clay</h3>
    <img src="images/clay.jpg" alt="clay">

    <p>Have you wondered what it could be like to make a coffee mug in your home, then to drink your coffee out of it within the same month? Well, there is a type of clay that allows you to do just that! Air-dry clay is the best for clay beginners, as it does not require a kiln, or a lot of hard labor. It takes roughly a day or two to dry, with some precautions, after simply molding it with your hands. However, if you get deeper into pottery, it is recommended you move to pottery clay or earthenware clay. Pottery clay is used for exactly what it sounds like - pottery! Kitchenware, pots to hold plants, and various containers can all be crafted using pottery clay. Though this usually requires a pottery wheel to mold the clay and a kiln to fire it, which is a little (actually, a lot) more work than air-dry clay. That also includes Earthenware clay, which is usually a terracotta color and also requires a wheel and kiln. Earthenware clay can make the same things that pottery clay can make and is typically better to use for pottery beginners, but needs to be sealed with a glaze to make it waterproof after firing.</p>
